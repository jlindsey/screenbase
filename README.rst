Screenbase
==========

A very simple tool that monitors your desktop for new screenshots, moves them to
your `public Keybase filesystem <https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs>`_, and copies the
link to your clipboard.

Works on macOS and (probably) Linux.

Dependencies
------------

On macOS, install `terminal-notifier` from homebrew to have notifications when
complete.

Installation
------------

Simply:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install screenbase


Usage
-----

By default, screenbase watches your ``~/Desktop`` directory for files matching a regex
tailored to macOS screenshot filenames (``Screen Shot 2017-03-09 at 5.29.50 PM.png``).
This regex is not configurable at the moment, but the watch directory is via the
``-d`` flag.

Similarly, screenbase uses your current username (via Python's ``getpass.getuser()``)
as your keybase username by default, which it uses to move files into your kbfs public
folder and generate the URL to it. This can be configured via the ``-u`` flag.
