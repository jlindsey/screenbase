Screenbase
==========

A very simple tool that monitors your desktop for new screenshots, moves them to
your `public Keybase filesystem <https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs>`_, and copies the
link to your clipboard.

Works on macOS and (probably) Linux.

Dependencies
------------

On macOS, install `terminal-notifier` from homebrew to have notifications when
complete.
